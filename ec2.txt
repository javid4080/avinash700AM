EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : 

	Elastic	CPU		Cloud
		Storage
		Memory
		Applications/software
		Network
		GPU


Traditional Scenario : Server to test your application : 

Application : 	100 customers --> 1M customers (We will look for 1M cus Configuration)

--> 100% upfront		ROI 

EC2: 100 Cus : t2.medium --> t3.4xlarge -----> Servers+ELB --> 100s servers --> 10 sers


Scaling :
Vertical Scaling : 
Horizontal scaling : 

Instance = Server


On-Demand ec2 instance : no specific workloads / usecases, If you want to test your application in AWS.. First time usage on aws.. 

Pricing : /hr and /sec (With min of 10 sec)


Reserved Instances (RI) : Predictable workloads, stable workloads, long term runs on aws..  Duration : 1 Year / 3 Years.. 

Standard RI : We cannot upgrade the selected configuration within the duration. 
Convertable RI : We can change/upgrade the configuration. 
Scheduled RI : repeated/scheduled intervals, we can run our ec2 instance.

Pricing : Full Upfront : Pay everything while purchasing instance. 
	  Partial Upfront : pay 30-50% while purchasing, remaining amount pay monthly 			    basis (but with reduced hourly price)
	  No Upfront : No need to pay anything, but most of the times cost same as on-			demand instances.

AWS Marketplace : We can register as a seller and sell our products/applications/instances.


Spot Instance: When we have flexible start/stop options for our instances.. If you need high configuration servers ar lowest cost for specific durations.. 

--> We need to bid our ouwn price against aws pricing. If bid price is same/greater than as aws pricing we will get an ec2 instance. 
 
--> Pricing history

--> We can create a fleet requets.

3 hr 35 Min 20 Sec --> Price increased and AWS Terminated your isnatccne : 3 Hrs.. 
3 hr 35 Min 20 Sec --> Price not increased and you Terminated inatccne : full duration 
								3 hr 35 Min 20 Sec


Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machene Image) : Choose your required OS. 

An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.


Step 2 : Step 2: Choose an Instance Type
t2.micro (1vCPU, 1 RAM) 

General Purpose : t2, t3, a1, m4, m5, m5d
Compute optimised : c4, c5, c5d
GPU : P, G
Memory optimised: r4, r5, r5d, x1e, z1
Storage optimised: d2, i2, i3


Step 3: Additional configurations

Shutdown behavior : STOP
Enable termination protection : YES


Step 4: Add Storage
Root : 30 gb

Step 5 : Add tags

We can define max of 50 tags/ instance.

Step 6: COnfiguyre the Security group.

Security group: Firewall at our instance level. 

Windows : RDP : Remote Desktop Protocol : 3389	: Remote desktop connection
Linux : SSH : Secure shell : 22			: putty / mutty/ moxterm
web : http : 80					: browser
web : https : 443				: browser
Db : Mysql : 3306				: mysql workbench
DB : mssql : 1433				: ssms SQL server management studio

Source : 0.0.0.0/0  (Anywhere)

Open Run --> mstsc --> enter

Step 7: Create a new Keypair and get connected to your ec2 instance.



Task : Launch a Windows ec2 instance with a keypair. Get connected to instance with the password. 

Change the password at OS level, and signout.. Login back to your ec2 instance using Keypair generated password.. try to login with newly setup password.


Task 2: Create a user in Windows server and provide him "Local Admin Rights" and "Remote connection permissions" .

Connect to your ec2 instance as newly created user.
